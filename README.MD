# Rest TypeScript server

This is a complete rest server, entirely coded with TypeScript. Is a ready to use server to authenticate users.
In this case, i used MySQL and Sequalize for handle all users into the DB. It also includes validations, middlewares and configs that makes this server a good starting shell for your next project.
